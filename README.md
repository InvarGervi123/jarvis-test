# Jarvis Test

This is a basic test project inspired by a voice assistant system, built following a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTDTIkLRQKQ&ab_channel=%D0%A5%D0%B0%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%A5%D0%BE%E2%84%A2-%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5IT%21) originally published on the channel **Howdy Ho™ – Просто о мире IT!**.

## Description

The project simulates a simple personal assistant similar to "Jarvis". It was built with inspiration from the video above and has been improved using both **AI tools** and **manual coding**. The improvements included:

- Refactoring and cleanup of the original code
- Small enhancements to logic and structure
- Bug fixes and code readability improvements

The code was last edited on **09/08/2023**, when the initial functionality was completed and enhancements were applied.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `speech_recognition`
